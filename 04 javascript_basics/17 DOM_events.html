        <h1>17 DOM events</h1>
        <p>Using Javascript to trigger on events</p>
        <p>You don't always want to have to specify beforehand how to interact with the DOM</p>
        <p>Many times we only want the interaction to occur on a particuar event, such as a click or a hover</p>

        <ul>
            <li>We achieve this by adding an Event Listener</li>
            <li>The javascript will be "listening" for an event to occur and then execute a function when it happens</li>
        </ul>
